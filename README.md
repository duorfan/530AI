#Work with data Locally (csv from Kaggle)
Ease of use and setup for data loading and manipulation
VS Code: The setup process in VS Code can be time-consuming, especially for beginners. Configuring the environment, managing dependencies, and running the terminal require extra effort. Additionally, I noticed that my computer occasionally froze, requiring a restart and monitoring system resources in the Activity Monitor.
Google Colab: In contrast, Colab provides an easier and more streamlined setup. It comes with pre-installed libraries, cloud-based execution, and an intuitive interface, which simplifies loading and manipulating data.
Resource management and computing power
VS Code: Running computations locally in VS Code relies on my computer’s hardware. When dealing with heavy computations, this can strain resources, as I observed with freezing and slowdowns. However, once the setup was complete, the process ran smoothly.
Google Colab: Colab benefits from Google’s cloud infrastructure, allowing for higher computing power and resource management without burdening local devices. This makes it better suited for handling larger datasets or complex tasks.
Extension capabilities and customization options in VS Code vs. Colab’s built-in features
VS Code: VS Code excels in extensibility, offering a wide range of extensions for customization and integration with tools like Git, Docker, and Jupyter notebooks. It’s more flexible for advanced users who want to tailor their environment.
Google Colab: Colab has built-in features for tasks like data visualization and machine learning, but it lacks the level of extensibility and customization offered by VS Code.
Collaboration capabilities (file sharing, notebook sharing, etc.)
VS Code: Collaboration is limited in VS Code when working locally. File sharing typically requires third-party tools like Git or cloud storage, and real-time collaboration is challenging without additional extensions or integrations.
Google Colab: Colab shines in collaboration. Its notebook interface allows sharing and real-time editing, similar to Google Docs. This makes it ideal for team projects or academic work requiring frequent feedback and iterations.
Accessibility and portability across different devices and environments
VS Code: Being a local tool, VS Code depends on the machine it’s installed on. While you can share code and files across devices, it requires more effort to ensure portability.
Google Colab: Colab is entirely cloud-based, making it highly portable and accessible from any device with an internet connection. It eliminates the need for local installations and ensures consistent environments across sessions.
Personal Insights
I appreciated how data visualizations in VS Code pop up directly in the interface, which provides a more immediate experience. However, I found Colab’s step-by-step structure more organized, as it allows viewing different stages of the workflow separately.
While VS Code’s single-page view makes it easier to see more content at once, I felt it lacked the organization of Colab for complex projects.
To conclude, both tools have their strengths and weaknesses. For quick, lightweight tasks or collaborative projects, Google Colab is the clear winner. On the other hand, for customization and flexibility, especially in long-term projects, VS Code proves to be a powerful local alternative once the initial setup hurdles are overcome.
